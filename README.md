# Ref2DOI
### üîç What does it do?

**Ref2DOI** extracts the DOI and title of each reference from a plain text reference list (copied from one or more academic papers). It uses text analysis tools to process the references and outputs three text files:

* `dois.txt` ‚Äì Contains the extracted DOIs
* `titles.txt` ‚Äì Contains the extracted titles
* `differences.txt` ‚Äì A list of references that might not have been correctly identified (so you can manually verify them)

You can use the `dois.txt` file with this free tool to generate a `.RIS` file for easy import into EndNote, Zotero, or Mendeley:
üëâ [CitationChaser](https://estech.shinyapps.io/citationchaser)

This tool is especially helpful when dealing with reference lists from **unpublished** theses or articles. For already published papers, the website above can often extract references automatically.

### üß∞ Requirements (for Windows):

1. **Install Python**
   [Download Python 3.10.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

2. **Install Ruby**
   [Download RubyInstaller 3.4.4-2 (x64)](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/RubyInstaller-3.4.4-2/rubyinstaller-devkit-3.4.4-2-x64.exe)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è After installation, follow the MSYS2 setup (`ridk install`) and install all three suggested items.

3. **Install dependencies**

   * Install `anystyle-cli` (used for citation parsing):

     ```bash
     gem install anystyle-cli
     ```

### üöÄ How to use

1. Run the `Ref2DOI.bat` file (double-click or run via CMD).
2. Paste your reference list into the prompt:
   * One reference per line
   * No empty lines between references
   * Format-check your list in VSCode if needed

3. Hit Enter ‚Äî processing begins.
4. After a short while, the output files will be saved in a folder named `exports`.

   * Input example:
     ```bash

### üí° Additional Notes

* The tool is tested on **Windows**, but it can also run on **macOS** and **Linux** ‚Äî just make sure to install the appropriate versions of Python and Ruby and run the script manually (since `.bat` files only work on Windows).
